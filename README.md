# MindEcho — AI Mental Health Journaling Platform

> A voice-first journaling app that listens, reflects, and speaks back — in your language.

MindEcho lets you write freely about how you're feeling. Claude reads your entry, writes a warm personalised reflection, and ElevenLabs speaks it back to you in a calm voice. Over time, your emotional patterns are tracked and a weekly audio summary is delivered to your inbox every Sunday.

## Overview

Mental health journaling apps exist — but none of them talk back. MindEcho combines three AI services into a single emotional support pipeline:

1. **You write** — anything, in any language, as little or as much as you want
2. **Claude reads** — identifies your emotional tone and writes an 80–100 word warm reflection
3. **ElevenLabs speaks** — narrates the reflection in a calm, human voice of your choice

No diagnosis. No advice. Just presence.

## AI Pipeline

### Per Entry (on demand)

```python
# 1. Claude writes the reflection
reflection = reflect_on_entry(
    entry_text=user_text,
    mood=selected_mood,
    language="Hindi"
)

# 2. ElevenLabs speaks it
audio_bytes = synthesize_speech(
    text=reflection,
    language="Hindi",
    voice_id=VOICES["rohan"]["id"]   # calm male Hindi voice
)

# 3. Stored privately, signed URL returned
```

### Weekly (automated)

```python
# Every Sunday 08:00 UTC
entries = fetch_last_7_days(user_id)
summary, dominant_mood = generate_weekly_summary(entries, language)
audio   = synthesize_speech(summary, language)
url     = upload_and_sign(audio)
send_weekly_email(user_email, url, summary)
```
